- **Audio System**: Integrated audio system for immersive sound experiences.
- **Networked Physics Engine**: Advanced physics simulation for multiplayer environments.
- **Animation System**: Robust animation capabilities for character and object movement.
- **Environment Support**: Includes biomes, foliage, wind, landscapes, and more.
- **Graphics API Support**: DirectX 12, OpenGL, and Vulkan compatibility.
- **Particle System**: Create dynamic particle effects for enhanced visuals.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Supports GOAP, state machines, behavior trees, and hierarchical task networks.
- **2D/3D Editor Mode**: Start with a 3D editor for intuitive development.
- **OCTAProperty System**: Similar to Unreal's UProperty and UFunction for enhanced C++ integration.
- **Voxel Engine**: Supports voxel-based environments for unique gameplay experiences.
- **Advanced Rendering Features**: Functions similar to Lumen, Nanite, and VSM for high-quality visuals.
- **Entity Component System (ECS)**: Central to object management, inspired by Unity and Unreal architectures.
- **Dynamic LOD System**: Customizable LOD settings for high-resolution textures (up to 8K) based on distance.
- **Landscape System**: Sculpting and building capabilities, working seamlessly with voxel technology.
- **Material System**: Designed to be on par with Unreal Engine's substrate.
- **Debugging and Profiling Tools**: Integrated tools for crash reporting and performance profiling.
- **Project Setup**: Similar to Unreal Engine with `setup.bat` for generating project files.
